# tdt4250-project

## Sirius

Currently, the examples is very much inspired by the Sirius-lecture. Note that the implementation of tools is missing (these are covered from around 01:02:40 in the lecture). _tdt4250.cb.diagram/description/diagram.odesign_ is where the views are created. I have created a simple view diagram- and tree-view based on the lecture. To see the view while editing it one can go to _tdt4250.cb.diagram2.examples/representations.aird_, this is supposed to connect the views and the xmi-instances. I experience a bug when I try to add/remove models in the aird-file, and the representations does not seem to get saved.
